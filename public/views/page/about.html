                <p>The Copenhagen Building in Cebu hosts Copenhagen Residences. The cityâ€™s best solution for affordable short term or <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel">long term accommodation</a> needs. You can stay either in
                    the new Copenhagen main Building with all hotel amenities or if you are travelling on a budget you can stay at Copenhagen East in close proximity to the main building. The interiors were designed by local interior designer Ms. Louise
                    Crisostomo specifically for the Copenhagen Residences. It is one of the finest modern buildings in the greater Cebu area and features all hotel services. It was commissioned by the Ironwood Property Ventures Corporation, a Filipino
                    company.
